This 2-piece bracket allows a modern SFX-size PSU to attach to the inner back-wall of the Apple PowerMac G4 Mirror Drive Door Case using 4 of the original holding tang slots.

Some kind of adhesive pad (I used stacked double-stick silicon tape) is needed to anchor the PSU at the 'front' end.

To mount the PSU you will need 4x 6/32 UNC countersunk screws of appropriatem length.
To mount the upright frame to the base you will need 2x M3 (or equivalent) countersunk screws, washers and nuts.
